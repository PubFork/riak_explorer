## Developer Instructions
Riak Explorer uses Erlang on the server side (to serve the REST API and to talk
to Riak), and Ember.js on the client side. Ember itself uses Node.js for
[command-line tasks](http://www.ember-cli.com).

1. [Install Erlang](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/installing/erlang/)
    (you know the drill).

2. (Optional) Install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), the Node.js Version Manager.
    The provided [install script](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script)
    is easiest:

    ```
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.25.0/install.sh | bash
    ```

    (After installing via script above, either reopen your terminal or
    `source ~/.bashrc`).

    Using `nvm` is optional - you can install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
    directly from the website. However, much like with Ruby and `rvm`, it's
    easier to upgrade and manage Node.js versions using this tool.

    This enables you to:

        * `nvm ls-remote` - View what Node.js versions are available to install
        * `nvm install stable` - Install latest stable version
            of Node.js (`v0.12.2` at the moment)

3. Use `npm` (Node.js Package Manager) to install the `ember-cli` package.
    (If you did `nvm install stable` above, you now have `npm` installed.)

    ```
    npm install -g ember-cli
    ```

    (The `-g` flag means "install it globally")

4. You can now run the Ember.js tests:

    ```
    cd priv/ember_riak_control
    ember test
    ```
